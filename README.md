# make_cert
Makefile to generate self-signed certs

Everytime I have to create certs I end up with a little less hair. This project is an attempt to give me a working reference.

Most of the examples I found on the internet were neither comprehensible or comprehensive.

The best I found was: https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/introduction.html
